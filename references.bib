	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in facilitating data collection in remote areas due to their remote mobility. The collected data require processing close to the end-user to support delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, we proposed a data collection scheme and scheduling framework for smart farms. We categorized the proposed model into two phases: data collection and data scheduling. In the data collection phase, the IoT sensors are deployed randomly to form a cluster based on their RSSI. The UAV calculates an optimum trajectory in order to gather data from all clusters. The UAV offloads the data to the nearest base station. In the second phase, the BS finds the optimally available fog node based on efficiency, response rate, and availability to send workload for processing. The proposed framework is implemented in OMNeT++ and compared with existing work in terms of energy and network delay.},

@article{s21082839,
	abstract = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.},

abstract = {The high efficiency, flexibility and low cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present huge application opportunities in various industries. Among those various applications, we focus herein on the use of UAVs in delivery logistics. The UAV logistics system has some fundamental characteristics that distinguish it from the usual ground logistics such as limited flight time, loadable capacity, effect of cargo weight on flight ability, and others. To handle the above issues, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for derivation of persistent UAV delivery schedules. To address the computational issues, a Receding Horizon Task Assignment (RHTA) heuristic is developed and tested with numerical examples for island-area delivery.}

	abstract = {Deploying wireless sensor networks (WSN) in rural environments such as agricultural fields may present some challenges that affect the communication between the nodes due to the vegetation. These challenges must be addressed when implementing precision agriculture (PA) systems that monitor the fields and estimate irrigation requirements with the gathered data. In this paper, different WSN deployment configurations for a soil monitoring PA system are studied to identify the effects of the rural environment on the signal and to identify the key aspects to consider when designing a PA wireless network. The PA system is described, providing the architecture, the node design, and the algorithm that determines the irrigation requirements. The testbed includes different types of vegetation and on-ground, near-ground, and above-ground ESP32 Wi-Fi node placements. The results of the testbed show high variability in densely vegetated areas. These results are analyzed to determine the theoretical maximum coverage for acceptable signal quality for each of the studied configurations. The best coverage was obtained for the near-ground deployment. Lastly, the aspects of the rural environment and the deployment that affect the signal such as node height, crop type, foliage density, or the form of irrigation are discussed.},

However, complete coverage may not be achievable when sensor nodes are randomly distributed in the area of interest.

The relationship between the number of nodes and coverage probability is analyzed. Comparisons between complete coverage and point coverage are made by analysis and simulation. Performance optimization and cost control are discussed for heterogeneous sensor networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been adopted in many fields of application, such as industrial, civil, smart cities, health, and the surveillance domain, to name a few. Fateway and sensor nodes conform to WSN, and each node integrates processor, communication, sensor, and power supply modules, sending and receiving information of a covered area across a propagation medium. Given the increasing complexity of a WSN system, and in an effort to understand, comprehend and analyze an entire WSN, different metrics are used to characterize the performance of the network. To reduce the complexity of the WSN architecture, different approaches and techniques are implemented to capture (model) the properties and behavior of particular aspects of the system. Based on these WSN models, many research works propose solutions to the problem of abstracting and exporting network functionalities and capabilities to the final user. Modeling an entire WSN is a difficult task for researchers since they must consider all of the constraints that affect network metrics, devices and system administration, holistically, and the models developed in different research works are currently focused only on a specific network layer (physical, link, or transport layer), making the estimation of the WSN behavior a very difficult task. In this context, we present a systematic and comprehensive review focused on identifying the existing WSN models, classified into three main areas (node, network, and system-level) and their corresponding challenges. This review summarizes and analyzes the available literature, which allows for the general understanding of WSN modeling in a holistic view, using a proposed taxonomy and consolidating the research trends and open challenges in the area.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) attracted significant popularity in both military and civilian domains for various applications and services. Moreover, UAV-aided wireless sensor networks (UAWSNs) became one of the interesting hot research topics. This is mainly because UAWSNs can significantly increase the network coverage and energy utilization compared to traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the high mobility, dynamic path, and variable altitude of UAVs can cause not only unforeseen changes in the network topology but also connectivity and coverage problems, which can affect the routing performance of the network. Therefore, the design of a routing protocol for UAWSNs is a critical task. In this paper, the routing protocols for UAWSNs are extensively investigated and discussed. Firstly, we classify the existing routing protocols based on different network criteria. They are extensively reviewed and compared with each other in terms of advantages and limitation, routing metrics and policies, characteristics, difference performance factors, and different performance optimization factors. Furthermore, open research issues and challenges are summarized and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are a class of aircraft without the presence of pilots on board. UAVs have the ability to reduce the time and cost of deliveries and to respond to emergency situations. Currently, UAVs are extensively used for data delivery and/or collection to/from dangerous or inaccessible sites. However, trajectory planning is one of the major UAV issues that needs to be solved. To address this question, we focus in this paper on determining the optimized routes to be followed by the drones for data pickup and delivery with a time window with an intermittent connectivity network, while also having the possibility to recharge the drones’ batteries on the way to their destinations. To do so, we formulated the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, and we showed how to use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve this problem. Several experiments were conducted to validate the proposed algorithm by considering different scenarios.},

ABSTRACT={In a complicated forest environment, it is usual to install many ground-fixed devices, and patrol personnel periodically collects data from the device to detect forest pests and valuable wild animals. Unlike human patrols, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) may collect data from ground-based devices. The existing UAV path planning method for fixed-point devices is usually acceptable for simple UAV flight scenes. However, it is unsuitable for forest patrol. Meanwhile, when collecting data, the UAV should consider the timeliness of the collected data. The paper proposes two-point path planning and multi-point path planning methods to maximize the amount of fresh information collected from ground-fixed devices in a complicated forest environment. Firstly, we adopt chaotic initialization and co-evolutionary algorithmto solve the two-point path planning issue considering all significant UAV performance and environmental factors. Then, a UAV path planning method based on simulated annealing is proposed for the multi-point path planning issue. In the experiment, the paper uses benchmark functions to choose an appropriate parameter configuration for the proposed approach. On simulated simple and complicated maps, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the existing pathplanning strategies. The results reveal that the proposed ways can effectively produce a UAV patrol path with higher information freshness in fewer iterations and at a lower computing cost, suggesting the practical value of the proposed approach.}
